# U.S. Civics

This repository is to construct a quiz around the 100 civics questions as part of the U.S. naturalization process.

I did this for fun, but there is of course an official version of the [practice test](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/civics-practice-test-2008) and an accompanying app.

Instead, I decided to start by downloading the PDF of [all the questions and answers](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/questions-and-answers/OoC_100_Questions_2008_Civics_Test_V1.pdf) and update it with the latest information.
